**[Spring 2023 CS 3505] Simon Game**
------------------------------------
Welcome to Simon! This classic game tests your memory by playing a sequence of flashing colors, in which you are expected to replicate back.
Can you beat my highscore of 15? Good luck!

This project was created for my CS 3505 class and was practice for using C++ qt Creator and MVC.
